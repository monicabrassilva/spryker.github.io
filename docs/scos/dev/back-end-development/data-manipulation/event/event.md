The `Event` module implements an [observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern), where you can add hooks (events) to your code and allow other modules to listen and react to those events.

There are two methods:
1. _Traditional Synchronous_: Listeners are handled at the same time as they are dispatched.
2. _Asynchronous (Queueable)_: Events are put into a queue and handled later by some queue service.
