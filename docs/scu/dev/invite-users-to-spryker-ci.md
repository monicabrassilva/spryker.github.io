To collaborate with a teammate, you need to invite them to your workspace and add them to a project. The only exception is the workspace owner who has access to all projects in the workspace.

To invite a teammate, do the following:

1. In Spryker CI, go to **People**.

2. On the **People** page, click **Groups**.

3. Select **Admins** or **Developers Read-only** depending on the rights that you want to provide to the inviting person.
