After connection of the repository to Spryker CI, you can change a target branch for pull requests (PRs). The target branch is the branch to which the changes from the Spryker Code Upgrader PR will be merged.

To select a target branch, do the following:

1. In Spryker CI, go to **Code**.
2. On the **Code** page, click **Branches**.
