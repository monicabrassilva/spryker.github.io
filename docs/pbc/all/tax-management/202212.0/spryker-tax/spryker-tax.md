Spryker Tax is the native solution for managing taxes that focuses primarily on the European market. The high level of customization requires development resources, even though you can manage tax settings in the Back Office.

Spryker Tax consists of only one feature: Tax. For more details, see [Tax feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/tax-management/{{page.version}}/spryker-tax/spryker-tax/base-shop/tax-feature-overview.html).
