{% info_block warningBox %}

Dynamic Multistore is part of an *Early Access Release*. This *Early Access* feature introduces the ability to handle the store entity in the Back Office. Business users can try creating stores without editing the `Stores.php` file and redeploying the system.

{% endinfo_block %}

This document describes the steps to take to delete a store in Spryker when using dynamic store.

## When it might be useful

Occasionally, a store created earlier becomes unnecessary. It may be a store that has been used for a brand, product, holiday, marketing promotions, or events, such as ending experiments with no production environment.

On the technical side, removing a store helps with:
1. By deleting redundant and no longer used data, which can take a lot of space up on the server, the store's speed is increased. The load on it for the purposes of indexing and searching is also reduced.
2. Reducing wasted memory and your storage footprint.


## Step-by-step plan

**For the sake of security, it is better to perform these steps in a test environment. Remember to also provide a backup of the database and other storages, if necessary.**

### 1. Backup Database.

Before starting the process of removing a store, you need to back the store's database up and ensure it is recoverable.
If you are using Amazon Web Services' Relational Database Service (AWS RDS), check [Create and restore database backups](/docs/cloud/dev/spryker-cloud-commerce-os/create-and-restore-database-backups.html) for more information.


### 2. Suspend P&S.

**In order to reduce the risk of data synchronization errors, you can suspend data synchronization through P&S.**

1. Enable **maintenance mode** by using command:
```bash
vendor/bin/console maintenance:enable
```
If you are using AWS infrastructure, check its relevant documentation on how to [Enable and disable maintenance mode](/docs/cloud/dev/spryker-cloud-commerce-os/manage-maintenance-mode/enable-and-disable-maintenance-mode.html).

2. Make sure there aren't too many messages showing in the RabbitMQ. Wait for the messages to be processed.

3. To suspend P&S and the Cronjob scheduler, use this command:

```bash
vendor/bin/console scheduler:suspend
```


### 3. Database. Cleaning data and configration in related database tables.

The number of tables that use relation with the `spy_store` table may depend on the use of the functionality, and on the installed modules.

The list of available tables with data that may contain a foreign key relationship:
- `spy_price_product_store`
- `spy_asset_store`
- `spy_availability_abstract`
- `spy_availability`
- `spy_availability_notification_subscription`
- `spy_category_store`
- `spy_cms_page_store`
- `spy_company_store`
- `spy_discount`
- `spy_discount_store`
- `spy_merchant_store`
- `spy_merchant_relationship_sales_order_threshold`
- `spy_oms_product_reservation`
- `spy_oms_product_offer_reservation`
- `spy_payment_method_store`
- `spy_price_product_schedule`
- `spy_product_abstract_store`
- `spy_product_label_store`
- `spy_product_measurement_sales_unit_store`
- `spy_product_offer_store`
- `spy_product_option_value_price`
- `spy_product_relation_store`
- `spy_quote`
- `spy_sales_order_threshold`
- `spy_shipment_method_price`
- `spy_shipment_method_store`
- `spy_stock_store`
- `spy_touch_search`
- `spy_touch_storage`

Store has new configuration tables that were used for dynamic store:
- `spy_locale_store`
- `spy_currency_store`
- `spy_country_store`

Make sure to delete all records related to the store. You may also have other related tables used in the project, make sure to check them and delete data from them.
After removing all related data from all tables, you can remove the row with the **store** data from the table `spy_store`.

### 4. Cleaning data in the key-value storage engine.

Data is stored with keys that contain the name store, if you use Redis as a key-value store.
The key name follows this format: `kv:{resource-type}:{store}:{locale}:{key}`.

Consider `XXX` as the name of the store to be used as an example.

{% info_block infoBox %}
Please note that the structure of data storage on the project can be organized differently, taking into account its features.
Below is a list of keys, taking into account the default configuration out of the box.
{% endinfo_block %}

Data stored in Redis that should be deleted includes the following:
- Stock information:
   - `kv:availability:xxx:*`
- Product details:
    - `kv:price_product_abstract:xxx:*`
    - `kv:price_product_abstract_merchant_relationship:xxx:*`
    - `kv:price_product_concrete:xxx:*`
    - `kv:price_product_concrete_merchant_relationship:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_abstract:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_abstract_category:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_abstract_option:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_abstract_relation:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_concrete_measurement_unit:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_concrete_product_offer_price:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_concrete_product_offers:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_label_dictionary:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_offer:xxx:*`
    - `kv:product_offer_availability:xxx:*`
- Product category details:
    - `kv:category_node:xxx:*`
    - `kv:category_tree:at:*`
- CMS pages and blocks:
    - `kv:cms_block:xxx:*`
    - `kv:cms_page:xxx:*`
- Merchant:
    - `kv:merchant:xxx:*`
    - `kv:price_product_abstract_merchant_relationship:xxx:*`
- Adjust `kv:store_list:` and delete store name XXX values in stores.
```json
{"stores":["AT","DE","XXX"],"_timestamp":111111111111}
```
- Delete key `kv:store:xxx` with value about store.


Note: A project's custom data stored keys may also be present.

### 5. Remove data from Search engine

If you are using Elasticsearch, each configured store has its index, which is installed automatically. An indexed name consists of the following parts:
- An optional prefix, which is defined by the SearchElasticsearchConstants::INDEX_PREFIX configuration option (for example, we use by default `spryker`).
- A store name.
- A configuration file name.
Index name components are delimited with an underscore, for example:  `spryker_xxx_page`.

The following indexes are available in the standard configuration (example: `xxx` -  store name):

- `spryker_xxx_merchant`.
- `spryker_xxx_page`.
- `spryker_xxx_product-review`.
- `spryker_xxx_return_reason`.

### 6. Resume P&S

Follow these steps to resume normal operations:

1. Restart the Cronjob scheduler through these commands:
Run:  
```bash
vendor/bin/console scheduler:resume
```
2. Disable maintenance mode by running the following command:
Run:
```bash
vendor/bin/console maintenance:disable
```


## Checklist

1. Make sure the deleted store is not available in the admin panel in the list.
2. Make sure that the store is not available through Yves.
