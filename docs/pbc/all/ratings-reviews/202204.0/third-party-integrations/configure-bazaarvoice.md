After you have [integrated the Bazaarvoice app](/docs/pbc/all/ratings-reviews/{{site.version}}/third-party-integrations/integrate-bazaarvoice.html), you can configure the following for your store:
- Bazaarvoice services you need
- Stores you want the Bazaarvoice UGC to be displayed in

To configure Bazaarvoice, follow these steps:

1. In your store's Back Office, go to **Apps > Catalog**.
2. Click **Bazaarvoice**. This takes you to the Bazaarvoice app details page.
3. Click **Configure**.
4. In **Settings > Select Services**, select the services that you need:
   - RATINGS & REVIEWS: These are the accumulated star ratings along with reviews that are displayed on the product details page.
   <!---- QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:--> 
   - INLINE RATINGS: This service displays the star ratings directly in these lists of products, for example, in search results, in the product catalog, etc.
   - Bazaarvoice PIXEL: Adds a single tracking pixel to your shopping cart page and product details page. It lets Bazaarvoice track whether the products that have more UGC have a better conversion rate than products without many ratings and reviews.

5. To configure the stores where you want to turn on the Bazaarvoice app, in **Settings** > **Store**, select the stores.
